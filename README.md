# Exploring-the-CB2-receptor-and-its-ligand-binding-in-silico
CB2 Receptors also known as cannabinoid receptors are found in the peripheral nervous system unlike its counterpart CB1 found in the CNS. CB2 has many benefits when activated due to its therapeutic affects and not have psychoactive properties.

Project Title & Abstract: CB2 receptors are cruicial 
Introduction: What is the biological problem? Why is it important? What were the specific research questions or hypotheses?
Methodology:
Describe the data source (e.g., "Raw sequencing data was obtained from NCBI's SRA, accession number...").
Outline the analysis pipeline step-by-step 
Installation of Autodock Vina
Installation of obabel.
Opening the predicted alphafold CB2 receptor and ligand on Pymol and finding the binding site
Writing a pdb file to config Auto vina
Ligand prepation turning pdb files into pdbqt and adding relevant charges
Receptor prepartion turning pdb into pdbqt aswell
Autodock Vina reaDY
Automate the docking.

Results & Discussion: This is where you shine. Don't just show a graph; embed the image and explain it. What does this volcano plot mean? What biological insights can be drawn from this pathway analysis? This demonstrates your scientific thinking, not just your coding.
Installation/Usage (Optional but impressive): Briefly explain how someone else could re-run your analysis.
